    "tsc --init" Initilize tsc project in the folder.
    "tsc -w" Watch changes in tsc file

    What is strong type in type script?
    What is string?
    What is boolean? --Done

    Difference Interpreter vs compiler
    Typescript file first compile in javascript code and javascript is 
    an interperter language and it run line by line.

    Why we need all of these thing like first we write our code in typescript and then we compile it in JS and then run our JS?
    Because type script is super set of JS and our Node will only understand JS code not our typescript code so we have to compile
    this code first and then we will run our JS.
